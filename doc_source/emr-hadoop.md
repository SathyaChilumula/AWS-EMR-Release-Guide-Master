# Apache Hadoop<a name="emr-hadoop"></a>

[Apache Hadoop](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/details/hadoop/) is an open\-source Java software framework that supports massive data processing across a cluster of instances\. It can run on a single instance, or thousands of instances\. Hadoop uses a programming model called MapReduce to distribute processing across multiple instances\. It also implements a distributed file system called HDFS that stores data across multiple instances\. Hadoop monitors the health of instances in the cluster, and can recover from the failure of one or more nodes\. In this way, Hadoop provides increased processing and storage capacity, as well as high availability\.
